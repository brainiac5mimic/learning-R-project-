# learning-R-project-
# test.R 
is what I cooked up for the CCBB application 
# Output 
shows the desired output for the program.
# SP1.fq 
is the original fastq file. It was a sample I found online that worked to show the cappability of the program. 
# SP1 - Copy.fq and SP1 - Copy1.fq	
are copies of SP1.fq
# new.fq	and new1.fq	
trim as soon as 2 of 5 nucleotides has quality encoding less "4"
# new2.fq	
trims as soon as 2 of 5 nucleotides has quality encoding less than "9"
